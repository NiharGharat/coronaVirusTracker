thymeleaf
- Templating engine to generate html responses

java version 12
- > I already have 13

Data fetching
- a service will go and get request to the url
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv

- Http request and response
Used builders, have a look

- Now, need to tell spring to execute a method when the application starts:
	- @Service to service class
	Make the class a spring service class

	- @PostConstruct
	When u construct the class as a service - execute the method of our data

- ISSUE
	- Wasnt an issue, by needed to manually change the java bytecode version to 13(which I had), in intellij
	- Was using html type of fetch - default
	- Needed to use raw in github
	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv

Data cleanup
- Use apache openCsv library
- Create stringReader
- Use openCsv and give the stringReader to it to make the csvParser
- Using header names - get the values

Cronning
- @Scheduled on the method to run
	- Specify the delay in execution of a cron expression
	eg - Scheduled(cron = "* * * * * *") -> sec min hr day mon year

- @EnableScheduling on main method spring boot to enable cronning

Issue
	- Was unable to run every 5 s with 
	@Scheduled(cron = "5 * * * * *")
	-> Correct cron exp shd be @Scheduled(cron = "0/5 * * * * *")
	Run from 0 in increments of 5
